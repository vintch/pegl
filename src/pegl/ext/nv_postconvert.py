'''NVIDIA buffer-post conversion extension for EGL.

This extension defines behaviour when posting a colour buffer to a
destination buffer with lesser depth or fewer components.

http://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/NV/EGL_NV_post_convert_rounding.txt

The extension only defines behaviour for this situation; no new code is
required. Importing this module can serve as a check on whether posting
a mismatched buffer will cause an error or behave as per the extension.
