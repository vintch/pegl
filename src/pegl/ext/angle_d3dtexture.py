'''ANGLE Direct3D texture handle extensions for EGL.

This module implements two related ANGLE extensions. The first extension
provides a way to obtain a pointer to a Direct3D texture that underlies
an EGL surface, thus allowing shared access to the rendering surface
from other APIs.

The second extension allows using a Direct3D texture as a client buffer
when creating a pbuffer surface. The presence of two extensions in the
one module presents no compatibility problems, since this second
extension depends on the first, and in fact it introduces absolutely no
code not present in the first extension's wrapper. All the extension
does is permit the use of a value from the first extension as a client
buffer type.
