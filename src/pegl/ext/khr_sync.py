'''Khronos sync extensions for EGL.

This module contains two "sync object" extensions available in EGL.

A "reusable sync object" is similar to a semaphore, and is used to
synchronize activity between client APIs or threads. Each thread can
manually signal and unsignal the sync object to release or hold a lock.
This can happen many times in the life of a sync object, hence reusable.

A "fence sync object", on the other hand, cannot be manually signaled.
It is created in the unsignaled state and is automatically signaled when
a condition is met. The condition depends on the completion of "fence
commands", a concept from OpenGL that has been extended to other client
APIs.

Both extensions can be supported in the one module because both define
the same extension functions, differing only in the attributes they
accept (and define). It is the application's responsibility to only use
the supported sync type if the implementation does not support both.
