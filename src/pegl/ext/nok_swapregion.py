'''Nokia swap buffer region extension for EGL.

I can't find any official specification for this extension; it appears
to have gone offline when http://developer.symbian.org/ was closed.
However, support is widely available through the Mesa library, which
gives just one function signature:

    EGLBoolean eglSwapBuffersRegionNOK(EGLDisplay dpy,
                                       EGLSurface surface,
                                       EGLint numRects,
                                       const EGLint* rects);

The Mesa commit message that added support also has this to say:
    This extension adds a new function which provides an alternative to
    eglSwapBuffers. eglSwapBuffersRegionNOK accepts two new parameters
    in addition to those in eglSwapBuffers. The new parameters consist
    of a pointer to a list of 4-integer blocks defining rectangles (x,
    y, width, height) and an integer specifying the number of rectangles
    in the list.

Lastly, this extension is obsoleted by EGL_NOK_swap_region2, which
indicates that this earlier extension provided the region(s) as a hint
only, whereas the later one makes it mandatory to only copy the given
regions. Given that extension's existence, this module will probably be
removed in the near future.
