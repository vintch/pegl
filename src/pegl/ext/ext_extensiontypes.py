'''Cross-vendor extension type extension for EGL.

This extension extends the existing extension-loading mechanism (which
requires a Display instance) by allowing extensions to be queried and
loaded before a Display is set up. Specifically, extensions are now
divided into "display extensions" (loaded in the existing way) and
"client extensions" (loaded without a Display).

As such, this module (unlike other extensions) should be imported
directly. Its load_extension() function can then be used to import
modules for client extensions.

    The client_extensions attribute of this module is used to determine
    whether the extension named is supported by this implementation of
    EGL. An ImportError will be raised to signify that the extension is
    unavailable. Also, even when it is declared to be available, if an
    ImportError occurs anyway while the extension module is being
    loaded, it will be raised.

            name for the extension.
