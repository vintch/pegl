'''ARM multisample discarding extension for EGL.

This extension allows the multisample buffer of pixmap surface to be
marked as discardable. This is aimed at GPU hardware that does all
multisampled rendering internally and only writes downsampled data to
external memory, thus making the EGL multisample buffer redundant.
