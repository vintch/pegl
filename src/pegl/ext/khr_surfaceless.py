'''Khronos surfaceless context extension for EGL.

This extension allows the current surface of a context to be None, in
order to render to a client API target without needing an EGL surface.

http://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/KHR/EGL_KHR_surfaceless_context.txt

The context module already allows the make_current() method of a Context
object to be called without a draw or read surface; any resulting EGL
error is simply propagated upwards. Importing this module can serve as a
check on whether that functionality will cause an error.
