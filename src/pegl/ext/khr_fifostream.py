'''Khronos FIFO stream extension for EGL.

This extension alters the behavior of the base stream extension to
operate in FIFO, rather than mailbox, fashion. That is, instead of
holding at most one frame (the most recent) and dropping any excess
frames, all frames up to a limit are held until consumed and the
producer may be blocked from adding more.

            the StreamTimeReferences tuple, or the string name of such a
            value ('NOW', 'CONSUMER' or 'PRODUCER'). If omitted or NOW,

        system-defined event), in nanoseconds.
