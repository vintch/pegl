'''NVIDIA sync extension for EGL.

This module defines a "fence sync object" that is very similar to the
one defined by the pegl.ext.khr_sync module. A fence sync object is a
synchronization primitive that is automatically signaled when a
condition is met. The condition depends on the completion of "fence
commands" from client APIs.
