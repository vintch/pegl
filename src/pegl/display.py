    '''An EGL display.

    In EGL, a display is not only a representation of a (physical or
    virtual) display device; it is also the overall context of all EGL
    operations (although "context" also has a different meaning in EGL).
    As such, details of the EGL implementation are accessed from a
    Display instance.

    Instance attributes:
        dhandle -- The foreign object handle for this display.
        client_apis -- A sequence listing the client APIs supported
            (such as OpenGL, OpenGL_ES, and OpenVG). Although I can't
            find it specified in the EGL standard, it seems likely that
            these will be limited to ASCII.
        extensions -- A sequence listing the EGL extensions supported;
            again, probably limited to ASCII.
        swap_interval -- An integer number of video frames between
            buffer swaps. This value is write-only and applies to the
            current context. It will be clamped to the range permitted
            by the context's configuration.
        vendor -- The vendor string for this EGL implementation.
        version -- A 3-tuple describing the implementation version, in
            the format (major, minor, vendor_info).
